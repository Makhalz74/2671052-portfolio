I learned how to use Git to save my code changes step by step. I practiced making branches to work on new parts safely without breaking the main code. I added new content and wrote messages to explain what I changed in each step. Then, I merged my work back to the main branch to combine everything together. Now, I understand how to organize my project history clearly and keep my code safe.
